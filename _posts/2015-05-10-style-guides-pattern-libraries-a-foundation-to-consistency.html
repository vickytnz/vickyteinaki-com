<p>First up. I had no idea that Rob Whiting created the popular <a href="https://twitter.com/uxdiscuss">#uxdiscuss twitter sessions</a>. Or was one of the people behind the <a href="http://www.designerhangout.co/">designerhangout.co</a> Slack group. Oops. I did know however that he is one of the organisers of <a href="http://nuxuk.org/category/leeds/">NUX Leeds</a>, hence why he was part of the NUX takeover at Dot York.</p>
<p>Anna Debenham's <a href="http://styleguides.io">styleguides.io</a> rightly got a shoutout (it includes references to such guides as GOV.UK, BBC's GEL and Google's Material Design).</p>
<p>Whiting pointed out that there's a lot of confusion between pattern libraries and style guides - as it turns out, a good way to understand the difference is to look at Mailchimp, who have both a <a href="http://ux.mailchimp.com/patterns">pattern library</a> and <a href="http://voiceandtone.com">a style guide (the acclaimed Voice And Tone) </a>freely available. The way I understand it from him is that a style guide can include a pattern library but a pattern library is not a style guide.</p>
<p>Confused? Whiting broke it down a bit more. He suggests that there 3 key elements of style guides:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Pattern guidelines</strong> - the bit that we all know that shows the thing</li>
<li><strong>Use guidelines</strong> - 'the why',  to ensure people understand context<br />
"Pattern guidelines are the Frankenstein's monster ... usage guidelines are the spark that brings them to life"</li>
<li><strong>Brand guidelines</strong>  - the part that makes is specific to a particular brand e.g. British Airways rather than Ryan Air.</li>
</ol>
<p>https://twitter.com/nuxuk/status/595678734750986240</p>
<p>He suggested four guidelines to making good style guides:</p>
<h2>1. Make it living (not separate, not dead)</h2>
<p>Guides that aren't tied to reality and can't easily be amended will likely not get used. As Whiting explained on an earlier project:</p>
<blockquote><p>I imagined that my beautiful and pixel perfect PDF styleguide would be used for years to come, but it ended up in a folder on someone's computer.</p></blockquote>
<p>He gave <a href="https://www.ibm.com/design/language/">IBM's design language</a> as a great example. I also like <a href="http://rizzo.lonelyplanet.com/styleguide/design-elements/colours">Lonely Planet's Rizzo</a>.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/nuxuk/status/595679774367993858</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>2 . Have things styled by default</h2>
<p>Much as a good CMS makes your text look pretty from the get-go, things should style by default (or in dev terms you should put your boilerplate code in the usage guidelines). Whiting suggests that the guide still has a role, but is more there as a historical document, for on boarding new staff, or covering edge cases .</p>
<h2>3. Think atomic</h2>
<p>For example, start at button level and work up. Brad Frost <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">has written at length about this concept</a>. Personally, I've seen that Philips is doing some really interesting stuff in this space as well.</p>
<h2>4. Make them organic</h2>
<p>Make them in plain HTML if possible - CMSes can break and programming languages fall out of favour, but HTML is largely HTML. (Obviously, this is easier in an online style guide).</p>
<h2>5. Make sure it remains collaborative</h2>
<p>Ideally, people should be able to  add to it or at the very least comment on it in some form of wiki system.<br />
It's useful to be able to see how a style guide has changed when people come into a project or have questions.</p>
