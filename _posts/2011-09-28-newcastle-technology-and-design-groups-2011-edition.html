<p>
	This is a follow up to a post I did <a href="http://vickyteinaki.com/blog/newcastle-upon-tech-design">on Newcastle technology and design events</a>. Since I last wrote it, a lot of new events have appeared (funnily enough, most of them at the Post Office NE1 on Pink Lane). So, in no particular order, here they are….</p>
<p><!--break-->
<ul>
<li>
		<a href="#design-ux">Design and User Experience</a></li>
<li>
		<a href="#tech">Technology(ish)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>
	<a name="design-ux" id="design-ux">Design and User Experience</a></h2>
<p>
	There is a lot of design and UX stuff in Newcastle, but that hasn&#039;t as such translated to meetup groups (though a lot of the time Supermondays is appropriate for more than just coders).</p>
<h3>
	UX Northeast</h3>
<p>
	<strong>When?</strong> Varies, usually a Tuesday though<br /><strong>Where: </strong>Usually Post Office<br />
	UX Northeast has been only running officially for a few months, but officially runs the Newcastle branch of UX Bookclub (where professionals get together and discuss a UX related book — though &#039;related&#039; can be pretty wide). Useful to come along to if you want to know who some of the user experience people in the Toon are.<br /><strong>Site: </strong><a href="http://uxnortheast.org">http://uxnortheast.org</a><br /><strong>Twitter </strong><a href="http://twitter.com/uxnortheast">@uxnortheast</a></p>
<h3>

<h3>

<p>
	<strong>When</strong>: varies<br /><strong>Where: </strong>Gateshead College (usually)<br />

<h3>
	North East England Photographers Group</h3>
<p>
	<strong>When</strong>: online <br /><strong>Where: </strong>flickr.com! And whereever you take photographs<br />
	If you&#039;re into photography, you should check out the Flickr Groups. (I got this tip from <a href="http://twitter.com/martin_88">Martin Cunningham&#039;s</a> <a href="http://vickyteinaki.com/blog/barcamp-north-east-review">Barcamp4 talk</a>). The official North East England Photographers group is huge, and even has a monthly competition. <br /><strong>Site: </strong><a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/neepg/">http://www.flickr.com/groups/neepg/</a></p>
<h3>
	Newcastle Photowalk</h3>
<p>
	<strong>When</strong>: varies, seems to end up being on a Sunday a lot<br /><strong>Where: </strong>somewhere worth taking pictures (it involves walking)<br />
	This is basically an IRL (though also twitter-based) group where everyone goes and takes photos. I&#039;m guessing there&#039;s usually coffee or beer involved afterwards. <br /><strong>Twitter: </strong><a href="http://vickyteinaki.com/node/123/edit">@npwalk</a><br /><strong>Site: </strong><a href="http://vickyteinaki.com/node/123/edit">http://www.flickr.com/groups/newcastlephotowalk/</a></p>

	Northumbria University Design School</h3>

	There are often a whole range of designery talks form professors and visiting academics. (There are also school talks every second Thursday that aren&#039;t really advertised, so it&#039;s worth keeping an ear out from Northumbria people!)<br /><strong>Site: </strong><a href="http://www.northumbria.ac.uk/sd/academic/scd/whatson/">northumbria.ac.uk/sd/academic/scd/whatson/</a></p>
<h2>
	<a name="tech" id="tech">Technology(-ish)</a></h2>
<p>
	For a relatively small city, Newcastle has a very active technology community, possible due to a lot of startups and EU grant money here. The -ish is because some of these talks after often more than just the latest progamming, and might be about weird and wonderful art or science pieces mixed with tech.</p>

<p>
	<strong>When: </strong>3rd Tuesday of the month<br /><strong>Where: </strong>PostOffice NE1<br />
	This is what is says on the tin: a meetup of people that work with PHP. (It&#039;s at the edge of my knowledge but I go along because Drupal and Wordpress run on PHP so it helps to understand it as a themer). It&#039;s usually pretty developer orientated, but they do have other topics such the <a href="http://vickyteinaki.com/blog/php-north-east-lee-simpson-design-frameworks">a recent one on design frameworks</a>.<br /><strong>Twitter:</strong> <a href="http://twitter.com/phpne">@phpne</a><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/php-north-east"><br />

<h3>
	<strong>Tyneside LinuxGroup</strong></h3>
<p>
	<strong>When:</strong> First Saturday (!) of the month<br /><strong>Where:</strong> Centre for Life<br />

<h3>
	The Geekest Drink</h3>
<p>
	<strong>When</strong>: a Friday night (varies, usually once every 2 months)<br /><strong>Where: </strong>a pub. Which one changes.<br />

<h2>
	How to find other events.</h2>
<p>
	Aside from word of mouth via Twitter, <a href="http://lanyrd.com">Lanyrd</a>, <a href="http://meetup.com">Meetup</a>, and <a href="http://eventbrite.com">Eventbrite</a> are useful for finding out about local events. I also recommend looking at the <a href="http://bit.ly/ukuxevents">UKUXEvents Calendar</a> and, more locally, the <a href="http://www.makerspace.org.uk/events/">calendar run by Makerspace</a> (both <a href="http://newcastle.skepticsinthepub.org/">Skeptics in the Pub</a> and <a href="http://www.life.org.uk/whats-on/events/bright-club-newcastle">Bright Club</a> sound interesting).</p>
<p>
	Know of any others? Let me know.</p>
