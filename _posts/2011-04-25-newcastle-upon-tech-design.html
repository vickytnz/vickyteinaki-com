<p>Shortly after I moved to Newcastle, I was given the advice that while this town can seem disappointing to those who expect the culture to reach out to them, it has a number of thriving communities for those who choose to search. (I was told this in a pub, which was apt, since almost everything in England seems to happen in a pub). And it's true: after doing a bit of digging via Twitter, local knowledge, and sometimes just plain old googling (the key phrase I later found out was to use “NE” for North East) I began to find a whole lot of tech and design events based here in the Toon.</p>
<h2>Geordie Geeks</h2>
<p>It’s pretty easy to fill up your calendar with tech related events — one week I swiftly went from having a completely open calendar to filling up four weeknights! I’ve got a feeling that I’m still missing a few, but the below are a start.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.supermondays.org/">SuperMondays</a> can be quite tech-based, it does sometimes cover more general web-based matters. It is held on — you guessed it — Mondays, usually at Newcastle University. I found that their local awards ceremony The <a href="http://www.thesmacs.com/">SMACS</a> was a great way to find out the good people/companies doing things in the area.</p>
<p>There are a number of specialist groups, such as</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://phpne.org.uk/">PHP-NE</a> (3rd Tuesday of the month).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.nebytes.net/">North East Bytes</a> — the Microsoft User Group (both currently on the 3rd Wednesday of the month)</li>
<li><a href="http://drupalnortheast.org.uk/">Drupal North East</a> (same night as above!)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.tyneside.lug.org.uk">Tyneside Linux Group</a> (bravely on a Saturday afternoon, the first time I've ever seen meetups held in the weekend!)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you just want to drink (and get a badge!) the "let x = nerds + beer" <a href="http://www.thegeekestdrink.com">The Geekest Drink </a>is an absolute winner (as is the website, with the most creative use of absolute positioned CSS I've seen in a while!)</p>
<p><img src="/images/282353754.jpg" alt="Badges" /></p>
<p><em>Badges! What more could a girl want?</em></p>
<p>On a more general digital note, <a href="http://www.codeworksconnect.com/">Codeworks</a>, an organisation with European funding (!) are responsible for a number of events.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.codeworksconnect.com/">Codeworks Connect</a> are regular events around innovation,and have included TEDxGateshead a few months back and the more recent book launch with Frank Rose. (The events aren't free but worth it, at the very least for the amazing food!)</li>
<li>The <a href="http://gelconference.com/">GEL</a>- or TED-like annual <a href="http://www.thinkingdigital.co.uk/">Thinking Digital conference</a>, happening this year from 24-6 of May.</li>
<li>The more web design and development focused <a href="http://www.dibiconference.com/">DIBI</a> (Design It Build It) happens in June — a two day conference with two tracks, one design, the other development.</li>
</ul>
<p>This year the British HCI conference is being held at Northumbria University, and there are often a lot of symposiums going on in July-Sept.</p>
<p>And another that people may not realise is open is <a href="http://www.girl-geeks.co.uk/Events.html">Girl Geek Dinners</a>. Members get in free, but non-members can attend various events for £10-20 depending on the event. And men can go — though they must be invited as dates from women, as a way to keep the event female-friendly.</p>
<h2>Design Magpies</h2>
<p>For those more into the design stuff, <a href="http://design-event.co.uk/">Design Event</a> (and its sister company Design and Business — aimed mainly at local businesses, but also available for the general public) do fascinating talks every few months. (I'm gutted to be out of town when they talk to <a href="http://design-event.co.uk/TalkTroikaSanky.php">Troika on the 10th of May</a>). They also do informal drop-in Fridays every month or two, which I haven't made it to as of yet, but am planning to in the near future.</p>
<p>Speaking of Design Event, they get their name from a week of local design events that happen here every year in October (sadly I missed most of it in 2010, but will be doing the rounds in 2011).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.designnetworknorth.org">Design Network North </a>does a lot of good in helping local businesses integrate design. While most of their <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130122001800/http://www.designnetworknorth.org:80/news/rddetails.asp?rd=1B2C2FBE-5206-11DF-96E8-0204E0D72085">Rise and Design</a> workshops are funded for local businesses, their <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20121227073922/http://www.designnetworknorth.org:80/news/other_dnn.asp">Design Means Business</a> conference in March was available to all and based on reports highly worthwhile.</p>
<p>I've also noticed a lot of interesting things happening with <a href="http://www.madeinnewcastle.org/">Made in Newcastle</a>, a design/craft shop that also runs workshops and exhibitions. And don't forget the number of universities around— Newcastle University, Northumbria University, Sunderland, and other community colleges as well. There are also a number of craft fairs, such as those at the Biscuit Factory/Holy Biscuit, Jesmond Mixer, or in the Tyneside Cinema. The Sage and the Baltic also do a number of interesting events, but generally more in the art rather than design sphere.</p>
<h2>Newcastle (Not So) United</h2>
<p>I do think it’s unfortunate that there is no real place that all these events are catalogued (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120207011625/http://north-east-england.techdiary.co.uk:80/">North East Tech diary</a> is rather sparse, and <del datetime="2014-06-28T20:42:10+00:00">NE Tech Events is "launching soon"</del>as of June 2014 is down), and may take this up with other people or even create a calendar of my own. (For those that are interested, I’ve set up a couple of public <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=l41bf3sdgfruh2hnktid2830tg%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=Europe/London">Google</a> <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=jrdj14e5gmh7g8q3gslshvjpro%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=Europe/London">Calendars</a> to share with other people, and there is a general <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=5iaao7piic3jkh3vvei44ujl08@group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=Europe/London&amp;gsessionid=OK">UK UX calendar</a> maintained by <a href="http://twitter.com/gaijinstu">Stuart Cruickshank</a>, though this doesn't cover so much of tech and design).</p>
<p><img style="width: 640px; height: 544px;" src="/images/Picture 15_0.png" alt="Design Events Galore" /></p>
<p><em>Events!</em></p>
<p>However, I hope this is a good starter for those like me who arrive here on the scene. What other Toon design/tech events are out there?</p>
