<p><em>I’m writing from Talk UX, the conference on UX aimed at getting new and differing voices heard.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/beckytopps">Rebecca Topps</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/EChesters">Elizabeth Chesters</a> gave a number of suggestions for accessibility, covering standard considerations for cognitive impairments but also going beyond this to consider thing such as cultural considerations.</p>
<p>Topps has a personal connection to accessibility - her younger sister has learning difficulties and so she took an interest in accessibility.</p>
<p>They pointed out that accessibility isn’t about disability as much as inclusivity: if no one on the internet knows that you’re a dog, it at best can also mean opportunities such as allowing a blind person to work as a translator (a real life example from their work with <a href="http://www.maccsuso.org.uk/">http://www.maccsuso.org.uk</a> ).</p>
<p>They had two particular bugbears with the current status of accessibility: first, that “ARIA tags are not magical fairy dust that make sites accessible" and that “it is pretty shameful that standard Flat UI patterns often fail accessibility tests”.</p>
<p>At the very least, you can check colour contrast on sites, with free tools such as <a href="http://www.paciellogroup.com/resources/contrastanalyser/">the CA Colour Analyser</a> (which the graphic designers at my work use).</p>
<p>More generally, they reminded people to think about readability and culture:</p>
<ul>
<li>in India a first name isn't required, in China first/last name are flipped</li>
<li>Middle Eastern cultures have weekends on different days of the weeks (Fri/Sat)</li>
<li>Remember that postcodes aren't always the same. I’ve personally had a huge issue with some of the assumptions that come around postcodes - up until recently New Zealand only had unenforced post codes, and even now they’re a 4 digit format which makes them fail until systems that expect 5+ digits or letters. (One Kiwi I know used to retaliate against this by putting his address in at 90210!).</li>
<li>Think multi-lingual: interestingly, in Europe 13% speak English natively, but 18% perfect speak German natively (8% are native Spanish speakers).</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, following good form and text practices help everyone:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write for scannability: Wikipedia is a great example as they encourages splitting text with headers and having skip links, "do you read entire articles? Nope, not got time"</li>
<li>Write simply and clearly - the free <a href="http://hemingwayapp.com">Hemingway website</a> is a great tool to give to clients to easily analyse if their copy is too wordy</li>
<li>Make forms easy to fill out (CX Partners <a href="http://cxpartners.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/v1-Form-design-crib-sheet1.png">have a great crib sheet</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, think about challenging your own assumptions be it through recruiting or testing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recruiting diverse participants can highlight your own biases e.g. that the UK has an unusual postcode system</li>
<li>Make personas with varying abilities/cultural backgrounds (as it turns out, Whitney Quesenbery <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/whitneyq/personas-for-accessible-ux">has a slidedeck</a> and in fact <a href="http://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/a-web-for-everyone/">an entire book relating to this</a>)</li>
<li>They recommended <a href="http://www.digitalpulse.pwc.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Attitude-Adjusters.compressed.pdf">the Attitude Adjustor cards</a> as a way of, well, helping people challenge their assumptions</li>
</ul>
<p>Since then, I also found a well researched and resourced post <a href="https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/taking-the-social-model-of-disability-online">on taking the social model of disability online</a>.</p>
<p>Topps' and Chesters' slides are available online.</p>
