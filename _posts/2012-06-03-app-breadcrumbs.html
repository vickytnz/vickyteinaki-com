<p>As someone who used to do a lot of web design, I'm familiar with the concept of breadcrumbs (enabling someone on a site to understand where they are on a site) and sitemaps (the catchall place for if someone can't find something). However, I'd never really thought of it in comparison to normal desktop apps.</p>
<p><!--break--></p>
<p>I've started learning an opensource app for some research, and was wondering why I was having so much difficulty picking it up. (I also disliked how it looked on a Mac so much that I learned how to change the icon and the splash screen, but that's a different story). As someone who is mainly self taught when it comes to learning programs, I read the help menus thoroughly when needed, but also rely on the top menu as being the catchall for most things that you can do.</p>
<p>As it turned out, this app could barely be used from the menu bar. Most of the actions were hidden in the right click of various panels (and a few for video playback were only in the help manual!). I decided to see what overlap there was (shown in orange).</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1262" align="alignnone" width="625"]<a href="http://vickyteinaki.com/2014/uploads/menus-non-menus.png"><img src="/images/menus-non-menus-1024x829.png" alt="Menus" width="625" height="505" class="size-large wp-image-1262" /></a> Playing treasure hunt with actions: almost all are hiding in panels with no equivalent on the Home menu.[/caption]</p>
<p>Pretty much the only overlap is Copy and Paste, and some formatting (which is actually a little different as well).</p>
<p>In comparison, the mightly Photoshop (the most extreme example I can think of) can pretty much be controlled with a combination of the menu bar and the Tools panel so that you can change selector etc. The Windows panel has a number of specialised panels that can be opened, but most are available at appropriate times to whatever you're working on.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1263" align="alignnone" width="843"]<a href="http://vickyteinaki.com/2014/uploads/photoshop.jpg"><img src="/images/photoshop.jpg" alt="Photoshop" width="843" height="470" class="size-full wp-image-1263" /></a> Photoshop managed complexity with greyed out menus and the Tools palette. Other panels help but are not necessary.[/caption]</p>
<p>I realise it's a bit unfair to pick on a community developed project (though I did pay $US70 for it!) and compare it to a heavily sourced commercial app. However, I think cases like these are interesting in showing what happens when the systems we take for granted aren't implemented. I also suspect that this is something that may come into contention in upcoming years as the line blurs between tablet and desktop apps.</p>
