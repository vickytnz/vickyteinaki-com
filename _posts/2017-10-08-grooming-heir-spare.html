<p>Thanks to the Sherman's I have a phrase that I use a lot for work: 'the bus number'. As in, if you were hit by a bus, how many other people would be able to get at the information you had? The closer this number is to 0, the worse it is.</p>
<p>They spoke about sustainable team and knowledge management.</p>
<p>When you're thinking about some form of responsibility, think:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who does this abstract responsibility impact?</li>
<li>Who does it effect?</li>
<li>I'll be successful if what happens?</li>
<li>If I don't do this, what will happen?</li>
</ul>
<p>For departments and stakeholders you deal with:</p>
<ul>
<li>consider your responsibilities,</li>
<li>role expectations,</li>
<li>knowledge you need,</li>
<li>skills, responsibilities</li>
</ul>
<p>Know how to delay, transition, reassign work and what to do with unplanned situations</p>
<p>Keep bus number high for every person - info should be visible to all team members</p>
<p>Don't ask 5 year question, ask 5 year journey to today and tasks for 6 months</p>
<p>Long view - future impact, responsibilities that will challenge me</p>
<p>There are always gaps - when you leave, leave behind a person shaped hole not a skills shaped one.</p>
