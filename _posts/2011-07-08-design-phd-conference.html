<p>
	On the 1st of July I attended the PhD Design conference at Lancaster University. While it&#039;s a conference jointly held by Lancaster and Northumbria University, paper contributions came from England to Australia, and generally all of a very high quality.</p>
<p><!--break--><br />
<h2>
	The Speakers</h2>
<p>
	The presentations were bookended with talks from people that had already finished their PhDs, which was supremely useful, with other talks ranging from first year to nearing writeup.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Martyn Evans </strong>kicked off the day with talk of his journey through his PhD <a href="http://www.ub.edu/5ead/PDF/8/Evans.pdf">on design futuring</a> and amongst other things, enlightened us about:</p>
<ul>
<li>
		<a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Kahn">Herman Kahn</a> (reputed inspiration for Dr Strangelove)</li>
<li>
		Ivan Illich&#039;s <a href="http://clevercycles.com/tools_for_conviviality/">&#039;Tools for Conviviality&#039;</a>  — apparently inspiration for the PC,</li>
<li>
		Eric von Hippel&#039;s <a href="http://architectures.danlockton.co.uk/the-democracy-of-innovation/">Design and Democracy</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
	but above all, I loved his finishing statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>
	"you start off a PhD wanting to change the world, and end just wanting it to be over."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
	<br /><strong>Jennifer Ballie</strong> of Chelsea College of Art and Design, University of the Arts London had some beautiful slides as she talked about <a href="http://thetextilesampler.blogspot.com/">her work into eco-textile design</a>.<br />
	She&#039;s looked into a number of ways to encourages this, from workshops to online platforms such as <a href="http://dressupdownload.com/">Dress Up Download</a><br />
	My favourite comment on her work was:</p>
<blockquote><p>
	"I thought that I&#039;d be making a digital platform, but realized the materials &amp; scarves were the platform"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

	Fellow Northumbria student <strong>Mersha Aftab </strong>talked about her research at Philips, which unusually started with research (rather than a literature study) due to industry involvement. She&#039;s actually found the process useful as it has honed the literature she&#039;s looking into, rather than just reading everything.<br />
	While she has found that getting time with industry is hard, she has a solution:</p>
<blockquote><p>
	"corner them at conferences and squeeze the informantion you need out of them!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	<br /><strong>Luke Feast </strong>of Swinburne University is an ethnographer looking into design methods. This meant he gave us a number of useful knowledge frameworks (objectivism, constructivism, subjectivism) as well pointing to researchers such as Rittel &amp; Schon.</p>
<p>

<p>
	<em>Luke Feast&#039;s Knowledge Framework Matrix</em></p>
<p>
	What was interesting about his background is how he emphasised the rigour in hard ethnography — his research into studying when and where insights happen in design studios mean that he isn&#039;t just sitting in meetings, but also going to the lunches, getting into the cabs, and generally following them around and watching for informal insights.</p>
<p>
	The other Northumbria presenter was <strong>Alana James</strong> (part of my first year cohort!) about ethical fashion. She&#039;s looking at the intention-behaviour or (30:3) gap, which is how 30% of consumers say they&#039;d like to support ethical fashion, but only 3% actually do it.<br />
	Her most stirring quote was a reputed saying amongst Nepalese women:</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<blockquote><p>
	"if you&#039;re lucky you&#039;re a prostitute. If you&#039;re unlucky you&#039;re a garment worker".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	 </p>
<p>
	Her tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>
		<em>Talk </em>— use the people around you/like-minded researchers, have a community</li>
<li>
		<em>Contacts </em>— get emails from people, keep in touch etc</li>
<li>
		… and <em>twee</em>t! Use it as a news feed, find people doing similar work to you. [Of course as a tweeter I liked this one]</li>
</ul>
<p>

<p>
	<strong>Marzia Mortati </strong>finished off the day with her PhD <a href="http://www.designhub.it/designingconnectivity">Designing Connectivity</a>. Her suggestions from her process were to consider the environment you&#039;re doing your PhD in and be prepared to go somewhere else for a while if need be (she was studying in Italy, but found that relocating to England for a while and collaborating with Lancaster Uni was key into getting the PhD done)</p>
<h2>
	Summing up</h2>
<p>
	One of the strengths of this conference was its focus — all speakers appear to have been briefed on giving tips for the research process, and they delivered.</p>
<p>
	The plenary at the end suggested the following themes, which I agreed with:</p>
<ul>
<li>
		visualization (there was a lot of mapping shown, and making visual sense of information)</li>
<li>
		social networking (be it twitter, skype, or general online communities)</li>
<li>
		sharing battle tips (as above)</li>
<li>
		the breadth/depth of design and methodology (design is a broad church).</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Perhaps the best summing up of the conference was from the panel as well:</p>
<blockquote><p>
	Design is about the question "why not?" and a PhD "so what?"</p>
