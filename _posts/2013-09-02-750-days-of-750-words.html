excerpt: I've been writing on 750 Words for a few years now (and have blogged about
  my love of it in the past). Still, I noticed today that I'd hit a fun milestone.

<p>I've been writing on 750 Words for a few years now (<a title="My Love Affair With 750Words.com" href="http://blog.vickyteinaki.com/my-love-affair-750wordscom/">and have blogged about my love of it in the past</a>). Still, I noticed today that I'd hit a fun milestone.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1763" src="/images/Screen-shot-2013-09-02-at-2.51.26-PM.png" alt="750 Days of 750 Words" width="832" height="201" /></p>
<p>(I should point out that I have been on the site far longer than 750 days, in fact, it's something closer to 1250. Still, 750 is a number that's not to be sneezed at!)</p>
<p>For people like me who haven't journaled in the past, it's a strange phenomenon to have an insight in to your past-life subconscious. (I use this phrase from a conversation I had with a long-time journaller friend when I started the site. She described journalling as "writing to your future self".) While there is a big push for quantifying your life, seeing your journal is about qualifying it, noticing how much you've changed.</p>
<p>When I look back at my first entry—on my 25th birthday, in April 2010—I see how much more unsure I was. I was living and working in Auckland and had just been offered a studentship at Northumbria University—a country I'd never even visited—and was grappling with an unknown I couldn't even comprehend. I see this unsureness and reserve in the early writing attempts. Admittedly, back in those days I was far better at knocking out the words in one go: these days I tend to get distracted and then forget what I was writing about. Still, through the practice of them I can see myself sorting through my concerns and insecurities.</p>
<p>Of course, there are cheats. I have to admit to a few days where I've got to 375 words and copy-pasted the rest in order to keep a streak going. Still, these days are few and far between now.</p>
<p>I like having a repository of thoughts, even if it is often ephemera that I won't care about in the future. The nice thing about it being a website is the reassurance that it doesn't matter if it's utter rubbish: it's not soiling beautiful paper or clogging up public space where it would annoy people.</p>
<p>Finally, I was having a discussion with <a title="Emma Jefferies" href="http://twitter.com/dremmajefferies">some</a> <a title="Cay Green" href="http://twitter.com/caygreen">colleagues</a> this morning about writing, and whether it really makes any difference to write and reflect on one's life and happiness. One idea is that journalling allows us to <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/just-listen/201002/mirror-neuron-receptor-deficit-mnrd-idea-whose-time-has-come">overcome mirror-neuron deficit</a> by doing it on our own, namely by enabling us to dig into how we feel as much as what we think. It's an interesting concept, and one I'll consider as I head into my next 750 days.</p>
