<p>Based on his many years of experience as a recruiter and a manager, Jason Mesut talked about getting the right people for your team and then supporting them.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Frame</td>
<td>Scope and position the team and the roles within it<br />
Make sure you understand it and position</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hire</td>
<td>Attract and assess the fit of people to your team<br />
Honestly represent your positioning - signing NDAs before interviewing can be weird but it allows people to open up -you want to see the best and worst</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Fire</td>
<td>Manage those that don’t and can’t fit into your team</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Grow</td>
<td>Develop individuals, scale the team, increase its presence</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Adapt</td>
<td>Flex to changing needs and the team dynamics itself</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Exit</td>
<td> Get out to let others grow and shape things without a dependence on you</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>They may be happening in parallel.</p>
<p>Framing and hiring affects the other stages.</p>
<p>Think WATCH:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Work</strong><br />
Consider the level of innovation, medium, nature (sector), who for, for candidates, relevance or transferable experience, interests and reservations</li>
<li><strong>Approach</strong><br />
Hard to asses - design challenges can be used carefully (though they can create false results and put people off - this can be a good thing?) if focusing on approach and used sparingly</li>
<li><strong>Team</strong><br />
Use your network to check whether people would be a good fit (avoid toxic people)</li>
<li><strong>Career</strong><br />
understand their journey, future (are they Experience Strategy, Interaction Design, User Research, or Information Architecture), personal situation (delicate area - some people contract to pay for a house or support new family but has uncertainty)</li>
<li><strong>Help</strong><br />
identify capability and growth areas - experience, aptitude, and aspiration (capability mapping can help with this)</li>
</ul>
